## Project information

Using concepts of geometry, light, textures and shadows, we built a representation of a cell, with elements such as a bed, table, sink, newspaper, among other typical objects.

## Controls

- **Camera**

1. Active Camera: Allows the user to select the active camera.

2. x coord: A slider that adjusts the X coordinate of the active camera position.

- **Spotlight**

1. Color: Allows you to adjust the color of the spotlight

2. Intensity: A slider to adjust the intensity of the light.

3. Limit Distance: Sets the maximum distance the light can reach.

4. Angle: Controls the angle of the cone of light emitted by the Spotlight.

5. Penumbra: Adjusts the softness of the edges of the light beam.

6. Decay: It controls how the light decreases in intensity as it moves away from the source.

7. Target X, Target Z: They allow you to adjust the coordinates of the target that the spotlight illuminates.

- **Celling light**

1. Intensity: A control to adjust the intensity of the ceiling light

## Objects

We'll now show you some of the objects we've created and how they were created. 

- **Bed**

The **bed** was built using basic Three.js geometries such as BoxGeometry for the frame, mattress and pillow, and CylinderGeometry for the legs. Above the bed, a **blanket** was created using NURBS surfaces, defined by control points that create a curved shape

- **Sink and Mirror**

The **sink** was built using a combination of ExtrudeGeometry for the rectangular base with rounded corners and SphereGeometry to model the **sink** in a half-sphere shape. The faucet and drain below the sink were created using TubeGeometry to simulate curved pipes. The **mirror** was built using PlaneGeometry combined with Reflector to create the reflective surface.

- **Spotlight**

Above the toilet we created a **spotlight** that projects directional light. The curved arm was created with TubeGeometry.

- **Toilet**

The **Toilet** class loads a 3D model using GLTFLoader. The implementation integrates a pre-existing model (Skibidi Head) into the scene, taking advantage of the features of three.js for manipulation and rendering.

- **Table and Stool**

The **table** is built using a box geometry for the top and cylinders for the legs. Above the **table** we created a **plate** which is modeled with a cylinder geometry that varies the radius between the top and bottom, creating a slightly conical shape and on the **plate** a **cake** with a cut-out slice. Above the **cake** we have also created a **candle** and a **flame** which is implemented as a system of animated particles, where each particle represents a small part of the **flame**. Next to the **plate** we also created a **helical spring** using a curve to define the spring's spiral path. Also on the **table**, a **vase** with a **flower** and a **newspaper** was created using NURBS surfaces. Next to the table we also implemented a **stool**.

- **Jail Wall**

To build the door, the **JailWall** class was implemented, which creates a cell wall with metal bars and a door opening. The wall is divided into three parts: two sides and a top part over the door opening. The vertical bars are distributed evenly across the width of the door, with each bar modeled as a cylindrical geometry.

- **Ceiling Light**

The **CeilingLight** class creates a ceiling luminaire consisting of an external frame and a realistic light source. The light is generated by a PointLight and is designed to illuminate the scene

- **Floor**

To improve the visual realism of the scenery, bump mapping textures were applied to the floor.

## Issues/Problems

One of the problems we had was shadow acne, which occurs especially in double sided surfaces, creating visual artifacts in the projected shadows, resulting in an uneven and unwanted appearance. To solve this we adjusted the shadow bias in the light settings. The adjusted value was -0.005 for both the spotlight and the pointlight (CeilingLight) which helped us to soften the shadows and reduce shadow acne artifacts.
